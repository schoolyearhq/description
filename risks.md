## Comparison: Schoolyear vs Traditional NGO Models

A common critique of NGOs is that they **crowd out government responsibility** or **distort local systems**.  
This is not unique to Schoolyear — it applies to almost all aid interventions.  

### Traditional Examples

- **Bed nets (malaria prevention)**  
  - Critique: governments won’t fund them if NGOs give them for free.  
  - Reality: large-scale NGO distribution saved millions of lives; governments later integrated nets into national health programs.

- **Cash transfers (Latin America, GiveDirectly in Africa)**  
  - Critique: creates dependency, replaces state welfare.  
  - Reality: pilots run by NGOs demonstrated efficiency; many governments eventually adopted cash transfers as policy.

- **School feeding programs (WFP and NGOs)**  
  - Critique: undermines parental responsibility and government budgets.  
  - Reality: once proven, several governments nationalised and scaled them.

### Why Schoolyear is Different — and Lighter

- **No parallel infrastructure**  
  - Traditional NGOs often build or operate their own schools, clinics, or programs.  
  - Schoolyear plugs into **government-recognised institutions** that already exist. No duplication.

- **Clear cost transparency**  
  - By publishing unit costs (*€200 = one school year*) and proof packs, Schoolyear clarifies what universal access would cost.  
  - This makes it easier for governments to budget and take over.

- **Easy exit logic**  
  - When a government abolishes fees or covers them fully, a school can **graduate** from Schoolyear immediately.  
  - Unlike parallel systems, there is no heavy infrastructure to dismantle.

- **Complementary, not competitive**  
  - Schoolyear strengthens public education systems by filling the financing gap, rather than competing with or replacing them.

### Conclusion

Schoolyear faces the **same category of risks** as other NGOs — governments may delay reforms if someone else is paying.  
But the design of the model makes these risks **lighter and easier to manage**:  
- no parallel systems,  
- radical transparency,  
- built-in graduation when governments step up.  

This makes Schoolyear more of a **bridge solution** than a permanent parallel provider.
