# Schoolyear – Open Problem Statement

## The Problem  
- Millions of children in low-income countries are unable to attend school because their families cannot pay the annual fees.  
- Schools, teachers, and government-recognised institutions *already exist*. The bottleneck is **tuition costs**.  
- Existing charities often:  
  - Spend heavily on overhead, marketing, or “feel-good” activities.  
  - Lack transparency (donors don’t see where their money goes).  
  - Don’t scale, because they try to build new infrastructure instead of plugging into existing systems.  

## Our Approach  
- Treat education as a **unit of distribution**:  
  - **€200 = 1 school year.**  
- **98% efficiency target** → money goes directly to paying school fees at recognised institutions.  
- **Verifiable impact** → for every unit funded, we provide anonymised copies of official enrollment/completion certificates.  
- **No feel-good charity** → just clean infrastructure that channels resources into existing schools.  

## Why This Matters  
- **Scalable** → the model can run anywhere there are schools + fees.  
- **Transparent** → donors see proof of exactly what they funded.  
- **Efficient** → almost all funds go directly to the solution.  

## What We Need Help With  
We want developers and system thinkers to help design a lean, auditable, and scalable platform.  
Key open questions include:  

1. **Data model** – how do we structure “school years” as verifiable units?  
2. **Verification** – what’s the simplest system for collecting, anonymising, and publishing enrollment certificates?  
3. **Donor portal** – how do we let donors (especially corporates) see impact clearly and securely?  
4. **Efficiency** – what’s the lightest infrastructure that avoids overhead creep?  
5. **Fraud prevention** – how do we minimise risk of fake students or double-counting?  

## How to Contribute  
- Discuss ideas in [Issues](../../issues).  
- Propose simple system designs.  
- Help us test lean prototypes.  
- Share knowledge from similar domains (payments, transparency, auditing).

✦ This project is at the **idea and pilot stage**. We’re not asking for donations — we’re asking for **collaborators** who want to help design a transparent, scalable way to fund education.
