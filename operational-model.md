# Partnering with Existing NGOs & Proof-of-Impact Incentives

This document describes how Schoolyear relies on **existing, credible NGOs** to onboard schools, and how the **incentive to upload proof** (anonymised enrollment/completion certificates) is created by tying **future disbursements** to **verified proof from the previous academic year**.

> **Principle:** Plug into reality, not rebuild it. Use trusted local operators to validate schools and students; release funds only against verifiable proof.

---

## Why Existing NGOs?

- **Local legitimacy:** Established NGOs already work with government-recognised schools and understand fee structures, calendars, and risks.
- **Operational reach:** They have staff/partners on the ground to collect and verify documents without heavy new structures.
- **Speed & cost:** Onboarding via known actors avoids duplicating monitoring systems and preserves the 98% efficiency target.

## Roles at a Glance

- **Schoolyear (platform/infrastructure):**
  - Defines verification standards and data formats (certificates).
  - Runs the pooled fund, treasury buffer policy, and risk/expansion rules.
  - Publishes anonymised proof and allocation reports.

- **Partner NGO (local operator):**
  - Identifies government-recognised schools; validates fees and term dates.
  - Collects **anonymised** enrollment/completion certificates from schools.
  - Submits proof packs according to the schema & timeline.
  - Flags anomalies and supports occasional spot checks.

- **School (beneficiary institution):**
  - Receives fee payments for sponsored students.
  - Issues official enrollment/completion certificates (or attendance registers stamped by admin).
  - Cooperates with audits and data minimisation requirements.

## Onboarding Workflow (via NGOs)

1. **NGO proposes school**  
   - Submits basic info and request for onboarding.

2. **Eligibility check**  
   - Confirm government recognition (license/EMIS code).  
   - Validate fee schedule and due dates.  
   - Check class size and capacity.  
   - Outcome: pass → continue; fail → reject or remediate.

3. **MoU & data-protection addendum**  
   - Formalise roles, timelines, and privacy responsibilities.

4. **Create school profile in registry**  
   - Register school with standardised fee = €200/unit (or local equivalent).  
   - Assign school ID.

5. **Set provisional allocation**  
   - Based on current fund size and buffer rules.  
   - Amount is capped for first-year onboarding.

6. **Initial disbursement**  
   - Release funds at academic year start once eligibility is confirmed.

7. **School operates, NGO monitors**  
   - Teaching proceeds.  
   - NGO prepares to collect certificates.

8. **Upload proof pack**  
   - Anonymised certificates + summary sheet + exception log.  
   - Submission deadline = end of academic year + grace period.

9. **Validation**  
   - Automated checks on completeness and formatting.  
   - Random audits triggered as needed.

10. **Decision**  
    - If proof passes → next year’s allocation unlocked.  
    - If proof fails or is delayed → allocation held, reduced, or flagged for remediation.
