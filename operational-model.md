# Partnering with Existing NGOs & Proof-of-Impact Incentives

This document describes how Schoolyear relies on **existing, credible NGOs** to onboard schools, and how the **incentive to upload proof** (anonymised enrollment/completion certificates) is created by tying **future disbursements** to **verified proof from the previous academic year**.

> **Principle:** Plug into reality, not rebuild it. Use trusted local operators to validate schools and students; release funds only against verifiable proof.

---

## Why Existing NGOs?

- **Local legitimacy:** Established NGOs already work with government-recognised schools and understand fee structures, calendars, and risks.
- **Operational reach:** They have staff/partners on the ground to collect and verify documents without heavy new structures.
- **Speed & cost:** Onboarding via known actors avoids duplicating monitoring systems and preserves the 98% efficiency target.

---

## Roles at a Glance

- **Schoolyear (platform/infrastructure):**
  - Defines verification standards and data formats (certificates).
  - Runs the pooled fund, treasury buffer policy, and risk/expansion rules.
  - Publishes anonymised proof and allocation reports.

- **Partner NGO (local operator):**
  - Identifies government-recognised schools; validates fees and term dates.
  - Collects **anonymised** enrollment/completion certificates from schools.
  - Submits proof packs according to the schema & timeline.
  - Flags anomalies and supports occasional spot checks.

- **School (beneficiary institution):**
  - Receives fee payments for sponsored students.
  - Issues official enrollment/completion certificates (or attendance registers stamped by admin).
  - Cooperates with audits and data minimisation requirements.
